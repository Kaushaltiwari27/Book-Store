# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

I'm excited to announce that I'm working on a new MERN Stack Online Book Store Website Project with Inventory Management! This project will include the following features:


1. Admin panel for uploading, editing, and deleting books
2. Inventory management system
3. User-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing books
4. Payment Method will not be there (will do a separate project for payment integration)

This project will be a great opportunity for me to learn more about the MERN stack and to build a full-fledged web application. I'm also excited to share this project with my YouTube audience and to help others learn about MERN stack development.
