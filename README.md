# Book-Store
I'm excited to announce that I'm working on a new MERN Stack Online Book Store Website Project with Inventory Management! This project will include the following features:


1. Admin panel for uploading, editing, and deleting books
2. Inventory management system
3. User-friendly interface for browsing and purchasing books
4. Payment Method will not be there (will do a separate project for payment integration)

This project will be a great opportunity for me to learn more about the MERN stack and to build a full-fledged web application. I'm also excited to share this project with my YouTube audience and to help others learn about MERN stack development.
